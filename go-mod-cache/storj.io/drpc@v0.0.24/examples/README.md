# Examples

 * `grpc` - This is a vanilla "Hello world!" style example of gRPC use. It exists to contrast the other examples.
 * `drpc` - This is the grpc example converted directly to use DRPC only.
 * `grpc_and_drpc` - This example provides a server that speaks both gRPC *and* DRPC over the same port.
 * `drpc_and_http` - This example provides a server that demonstrates DRPC's built-in HTTP/JSON translation support, and serving HTTP and DRPC over the same port as well.
